Pack Description:

Welcome to ImpactFlux.  This is a hardcore questing modpack aimed at exploring the world of Minecraft.  The goal of this pack is to have players complete challenges in vanilla and modded Minecraft they have yet to do. The pack will be hard as lives are not easily earned and the quests will push the player.  All biome generation for 1.7.10 is included but will need to be enabled by the user.
